# End-to-End Supply Chain Data Generator

This repository contains a **Python** script to generate a full synthetic dataset for a multi-hub apparel distribution network.  
It produces dimensions and facts mirroring real supply-chain processes, enabling you to prototype analytics, dashboards, or ML models without access to confidential operational data.

## Features

- **Reproducible**: Seeds for Python, NumPy, and Faker guarantee identical outputs.
- **Multi-Hub Network**: Three regional hubs (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore) with specialty categories.
- **Demand Modeling**: Seasonality (quarter, month, weekday) + store-level multipliers.
- **Partial Fulfillment & Auto-Reorder**:
  - Ship up to available stock, record shortfalls.
  - Trigger inbound replenishment for unmet orders.
- **Inventory Snapshots**: Daily on-hand levels driven by real inbounds & shipments.
- **Return Simulation**: Category-specific return reasons and volumes.
- **Configurable**: Central `CFG` dictionary for counts, date ranges, thresholds.
